basic binary search implementation

import bisect

Bisect(array, target, low, high) //search the index of rightmost insertion point 

Bisect_left(array, target, low, high) // search the index of leftmost insertion point




l = 0
h = n-1

    while l <= h:
        m = (l+h)//2

        if median == ar[m]:
            if ar[m] == ar[m+1]: //this additional line gives you Bisect_right operation 
                l = m+1
            else:
                break
        elif median < ar[m]:
            h = m-1
        else:
            l = m+1
